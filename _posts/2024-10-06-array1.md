# Understanding array
Array is a continuous DS whose data are stored on continuous addresses.
Remember: 1. the index of array starts from 0.
          2. It's covering old elements with new elements instead of deleting old elements.

# 704 Binary Search 
An easy and traditional way of searching for a specific element in a sorted array.(it has to be sorted)
The very basic version of Binary Search is to detect a specific number which it is guranteed to be in the array.

__Easily Mistaken__
1. The way the indices moves.
   When need to move the indices when the middle element is not what we are looking for.
   How the indices move quite depend on the indices we set at the very begining.

2. The condition of ending the iteration.  
   That also depends on the begining indices.
   Let's say the indices are left and right
   When the indices left and right are equal to 0 and length - 1 respectively, we can say the condition is __left <= right__.
   Because it could be left == right at some times.
   While the indices left and right are equal to 0 and length respectively, the condtion changes to __left < right__.
   That's because there's no way that left == right in this situation unless the array has 0 elements.

# 27 Remove Element
Covering the front part of an array with elements that are not equal to the specific one.
__Two pointers__: The faster pointer is to iterate the whole array while the slower pointer is for covering the elements by element which the faster pointer points at.
That means that the slower one will move until the faster one finds an element that is not equal to the preset value.
